# Strings

**1. String Data Type in Python:**

- In Python, a string is a sequence of characters, enclosed within single (' '), double (" "), or triple (''' ''' or """ """) quotes.
- Strings are immutable, meaning you cannot change the characters within a string directly. Instead, you create new strings.
- You can access individual characters in a string using indexing, e.g., `my_string[0]` will give you the first character.
- Strings support various built-in methods, such as `len()`, `upper()`, `lower()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, and more, for manipulation.
